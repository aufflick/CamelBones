=head1 NAME

Net::LDAP::Message - Message response from LDAP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Net::LDAP;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Net::LDAP::Message> is a base class for the objects returned by the
L<Net::LDAP> methods
L<abandon|Net::LDAP/abandon>,
L<add|Net::LDAP/add>,
L<bind|Net::LDAP/bind>,
L<compare|Net::LDAP/compare>,
L<delete|Net::LDAP/delete>,
L<modify|Net::LDAP/modify>,
L<moddn|Net::LDAP/moddn>,
L<search|Net::LDAP/search> and
L<unbind|Net::LDAP/unbind>.

The sub-class L<Net::LDAP::Search> returned by
L<search|Net::LDAP/search> also defines many methods.

If the L<Net::LDAP> object is in async mode then all these methods,
except C<done> and C<mesg_id>, will cause a wait until the request is completed.

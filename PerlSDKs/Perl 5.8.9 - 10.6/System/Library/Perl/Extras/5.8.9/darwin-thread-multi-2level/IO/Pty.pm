=head1 NAME

IO::Pty - Pseudo TTY object class

=head1 VERSION

1.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Pty;

    $pty = new IO::Pty;

    $slave  = $pty->slave;

    foreach $val (1..10) {
	print $pty "$val\n";
	$_ = <$slave>;
	print "$_";
    }

    close($slave);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<IO::Pty> provides an interface to allow the creation of a pseudo tty.

C<IO::Pty> inherits from C<IO::Handle> and so provide all the methods
defined by the C<IO::Handle> package.

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  If you have
problems, see L<IO::Tty> for help.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 3

=item new

The C<new> constructor takes no arguments and returns a new file
object which is the master side of the pseudo tty.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item ttyname()

Returns the name of the slave pseudo tty. On UNIX machines this will
be the pathname of the device.  Use this name for informational
purpose only, to get a slave filehandle, use slave().

=item slave()

The C<slave> method will return the slave filehandle of the given
master pty, opening it anew if necessary.  If IO::Stty is installed,
you can then call C<$slave-E<gt>stty()> to modify the terminal settings.

=item close_slave()

The slave filehandle will be closed and destroyed.  This is necessary
in the parent after forking to get rid of the open filehandle,
otherwise the parent will not notice if the child exits.  Subsequent
calls of C<slave()> will return a newly opened slave filehandle.

=item make_slave_controlling_terminal()

This will set the slave filehandle as the controlling terminal of the
current process, which will become a session leader, so this should
only be called by a child process after a fork(), e.g. in the callback
to C<sync_exec()> (see L<Proc::SyncExec>).  See the C<try> script
(also C<test.pl>) for an example how to correctly spawn a subprocess.

=item set_raw()

Will set the pty to raw.  Note that this is a one-way operation, you
need IO::Stty to set the terminal settings to anything else.

On some systems, the master pty is not a tty.  This method checks for
that and returns success anyway on such systems.  Note that this
method must be called on the slave, and probably should be called on
the master, just to be sure, i.e.

  $pty->slave->set_raw();
  $pty->set_raw();


=item clone_winsize_from(\*FH)

Gets the terminal size from filehandle FH (which must be a terminal)
and transfers it to the pty.  Returns true on success and undef on
failure.  Note that this must be called upon the I<slave>, i.e.

 $pty->slave->clone_winsize_from(\*STDIN);

On some systems, the master pty also isatty.  I actually have no
idea if setting terminal sizes there is passed through to the slave,
so if this method is called for a master that is not a tty, it
silently returns OK.

See the C<try> script for example code how to propagate SIGWINCH.

=head1 NAME

IO::Tty - Low-level allocate a pseudo-Tty, import constants.

=head1 VERSION

1.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Tty qw(TIOCNOTTY);
    ...
    # use only to import constants, see IO::Pty to create ptys.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<IO::Tty> is used internally by C<IO::Pty> to create a pseudo-tty.
You wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
C<IO::Pty>.  For a list of importable constants, see
L<IO::Tty::Constant>.

Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin
environment, see L<http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  From my
experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine.  Find below a list
of systems that C<IO::Tty> should work on.  A more detailed table
(which is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project
pages document manager at SourceForge
L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/>.

If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
"verified" list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.

If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of C<IO::Tty>,
do a C<'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname -a'> and send me
(F<RGiersig@cpan.org>) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
that.  There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...

If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V'
is a good start; also, the output from "perl Makefile.PL" contains a
lot of interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get
an overview.  Thanks!


=head1 VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES

This is a list of systems that C<IO::Tty> seems to work on ('make
test' passes) with comments about "features":

=over 4

=item * AIX 4.3

Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

=item * AIX 5.x

=item * FreeBSD 4.4

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * OpenBSD 2.8

The ioctl TIOCSCTTY sometimes fails.  This is also known in
Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * Darwin 7.9.0

=item * HPUX 10.20 & 11.00

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * IRIX 6.5

=item * Linux 2.2.x & 2.4.x

Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

=item * OSF 4.0

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6

Has the "feature" of returning EOF just once?!

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)

When you send (print) a too long line (>160 chars) to a non-raw pty,
the call just hangs forever and even alarm() cannot get you out.
Don't complain to me...

EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

=item * z/OS

=back

The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but
a previous version worked on them:

=over 4

=item * SCO Unix

=item * NetBSD

probably the same as the other *BSDs...

=back

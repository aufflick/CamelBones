=head1 NAME

Apache::Test - Test.pm wrapper with helpers for testing Apache

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Apache::Test;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Apache::Test> is a wrapper around the standard C<Test.pm> with
helpers for testing an Apache server.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item plan

This function is a wrapper around C<Test::plan>:

    plan tests => 3;

just like using Test.pm, plan 3 tests.

If the first argument is an object, such as an C<Apache::RequestRec>
object, C<STDOUT> will be tied to it. The C<Test.pm> global state will
also be refreshed by calling C<Apache::Test::test_pm_refresh>. For
example:

    plan $r, tests => 7;

ties STDOUT to the request object C<$r>.

If there is a last argument that doesn't belong to C<Test::plan>
(which expects a balanced hash), it's used to decide whether to
continue with the test or to skip it all-together. This last argument
can be:

=over

=item * a C<SCALAR>

the test is skipped if the scalar has a false value. For example:

  plan tests => 5, 0;

But this won't hint the reason for skipping therefore it's better to
use need():

  plan tests => 5,
      need 'LWP',
           { "not Win32" => sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32'} };

see C<need()> for more info.

=item * an C<ARRAY> reference

need_module() is called for each value in this array. The test is
skipped if need_module() returns false (which happens when at least
one C or Perl module from the list cannot be found).

Watch out for case insensitive file systems or duplicate modules
with the same name.  I.E.  If you mean mod_env.c
   need_module('mod_env.c')
Not
   need_module('env')

=item * a C<CODE> reference

the tests will be skipped if the function returns a false value. For
example:

    plan tests => 5, need_lwp;

the test will be skipped if LWP is not available

=back

All other arguments are passed through to I<Test::plan> as is.

=item ok

Same as I<Test::ok>, see I<Test.pm> documentation.

=item sok

Allows to skip a sub-test, controlled from the command line.  The
argument to sok() is a CODE reference or a BLOCK whose return value
will be passed to ok(). By default behaves like ok(). If all sub-tests
of the same test are written using sok(), and a test is executed as:

  % ./t/TEST -v skip_subtest 1 3

only sub-tests 1 and 3 will be run, the rest will be skipped.

=item skip

Same as I<Test::skip>, see I<Test.pm> documentation.

=item test_pm_refresh

Normally called by I<Apache::Test::plan>, this function will refresh
the global state maintained by I<Test.pm>, allowing C<plan> and
friends to be called more than once per-process.  This function is not
exported.

=back

Functions that can be used as a last argument to the extended plan().
Note that for each C<need_*> function there is a C<have_*> equivalent
that performs the exact same function except that it is designed to
be used outside of C<plan()>.  C<need_*> functions have the side effect
of generating skip messages, if the test is skipped.  C<have_*> functions
don't have this side effect.  In other words, use C<need_apache()>
with C<plan()> to decide whether a test will run, but C<have_apache()>
within test logic to adjust expectations based on older or newer
server versions.

=over

=item need_http11

  plan tests => 5, need_http11;

Require HTTP/1.1 support.

=item need_ssl

  plan tests => 5, need_ssl;

Require SSL support.

Not exported by default.

=item need_lwp

  plan tests => 5, need_lwp;

Require LWP support.

=item need_cgi

  plan tests => 5, need_cgi;

Requires mod_cgi or mod_cgid to be installed.

=item need_php

  plan tests => 5, need_php;

Requires a PHP module to be installed (version 4 or 5).

=item need_php4

  plan tests => 5, need_php4;

Requires a PHP version 4 module to be installed.

=item need_imagemap

  plan tests => 5, need_imagemap;

Requires a mod_imagemap or mod_imap be installed

=item need_apache

  plan tests => 5, need_apache 2;

Requires Apache 2nd generation httpd-2.x.xx

  plan tests => 5, need_apache 1;

Requires Apache 1st generation (apache-1.3.xx)

See also C<need_min_apache_version()>.

=item need_min_apache_version

Used to require a minimum version of Apache.

For example:

  plan tests => 5, need_min_apache_version("2.0.40");

requires Apache 2.0.40 or higher.

=item need_apache_version

Used to require a specific version of Apache.

For example:

  plan tests => 5, need_apache_version("2.0.40");

requires Apache 2.0.40.

=item need_apache_mpm

Used to require a specific Apache Multi-Processing Module.

For example:

  plan tests => 5, need_apache_mpm('prefork');

requires the prefork MPM.

=item need_perl

  plan tests => 5, need_perl 'iolayers';
  plan tests => 5, need_perl 'ithreads';

Requires a perl extension to be present, or perl compiled with certain
capabilities.

The first example tests whether C<PerlIO> is available, the second
whether:

  $Config{useithread} eq 'define';

=item need_min_perl_version

Used to require a minimum version of Perl.

For example:

  plan tests => 5, need_min_perl_version("5.008001");

requires Perl 5.8.1 or higher.

=item need_module

  plan tests => 5, need_module 'CGI';
  plan tests => 5, need_module qw(CGI Find::File);
  plan tests => 5, need_module ['CGI', 'Find::File', 'cgid'];

Requires Apache C and Perl modules. The function accept a list of
arguments or a reference to a list.

In case of C modules, depending on how the module name was passed it
may pass through the following completions:

=over

=item 1 need_module 'proxy_http.c'

If there is the I<.c> extension, the module name will be looked up as
is, i.e. I<'proxy_http.c'>.

=item 2 need_module 'mod_cgi'

The I<.c> extension will be appended before the lookup, turning it into
I<'mod_cgi.c'>.

=item 3 need_module 'cgi'

The I<.c> extension and I<mod_> prefix will be added before the
lookup, turning it into I<'mod_cgi.c'>.

=back

=item need_min_module_version

Used to require a minimum version of a module

For example:

  plan tests => 5, need_min_module_version(CGI => 2.81);

requires C<CGI.pm> version 2.81 or higher.

Currently works only for perl modules.

=item need

  plan tests => 5,
      need 'LWP',
           { "perl >= 5.8.0 and w/ithreads is required" =>
             ($Config{useperlio} && $] >= 5.008) },
           { "not Win32"                 => sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32' },
             "foo is disabled"           => \&is_foo_enabled,
           },
           'cgid';

need() is more generic function which can impose multiple requirements
at once. All requirements must be satisfied.

need()'s argument is a list of things to test. The list can include
scalars, which are passed to need_module(), and hash references. If
hash references are used, the keys, are strings, containing a reason
for a failure to satisfy this particular entry, the values are the
condition, which are satisfaction if they return true. If the value is
0 or 1, it used to decide whether the requirements very satisfied, so
you can mix special C<need_*()> functions that return 0 or 1. For
example:

  plan tests => 1, need 'Compress::Zlib', 'deflate',
      need_min_apache_version("2.0.49");

If the scalar value is a string, different from 0 or 1, it's passed to
I<need_module()>.  If the value is a code reference, it gets executed
at the time of check and its return value is used to check the
condition. If the condition check fails, the provided (in a key)
reason is used to tell user why the test was skipped.

In the presented example, we require the presence of the C<LWP> Perl
module, C<mod_cgid>, that we run under perl E<gt>= 5.7.3 on Win32.

It's possible to put more than one requirement into a single hash
reference, but be careful that the keys will be different.

It's also important to mention to avoid using:

  plan tests => 1, requirement1 && requirement2;

technique. While test-wise that technique is equivalent to:

  plan tests => 1, need requirement1, requirement2;

since the test will be skipped, unless all the rules are satisfied,
it's not equivalent for the end users. The second technique, deploying
C<need()> and a list of requirements, always runs all the requirement
checks and reports all the missing requirements. In the case of the
first technique, if the first requirement fails, the second is not
run, and the missing requirement is not reported. So let's say all the
requirements are missing Apache modules, and a user wants to satisfy
all of these and run the test suite again. If all the unsatisfied
requirements are reported at once, she will need to rebuild Apache
once. If only one requirement is reported at a time, she will have to
rebuild Apache as many times as there are elements in the C<&&>
statement.

Also see plan().

=item under_construction

  plan tests => 5, under_construction;

skip all tests, noting that the tests are under construction

=item skip_reason

  plan tests => 5, skip_reason('my custom reason');

skip all tests.  the reason you specify will be given at runtime.
if no reason is given a default reason will be used.

=head1 Additional Configuration Variables

=item basic_config

  my $basic_cfg = Apache::Test::basic_config();
  $basic_cfg->write_perlscript($file, $content);

C<basic_config()> is similar to C<config()>, but doesn't contain any
httpd-specific information and should be used for operations that
don't require any httpd-specific knowledge.

=item config

  my $cfg = Apache::Test::config();
  my $server_rev = $cfg->{server}->{rev};
  ...

C<config()> gives an access to the configuration object.

=item vars

  my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars->{serverroot};
  my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars('serverroot');
  my($top_dir, $t_dir) = Apache::Test::vars(qw(top_dir t_dir));

C<vars()> gives an access to the configuration variables, otherwise
accessible as:

  $vars = Apache::Test::config()->{vars};

If no arguments are passed, the reference to the variables hash is
returned. If one or more arguments are passed the corresponding values
are returned.

=head1 Test::More Integration

There are a few caveats if you want to use I<Apache::Test> with
I<Test::More> instead of the default I<Test> backend.  The first is
that I<Test::More> requires you to use its own C<plan()> function
and not the one that ships with I<Apache::Test>.  I<Test::More> also
defines C<ok()> and C<skip()> functions that are different, and
simply C<use>ing both modules in your test script will lead to redefined
warnings for these subroutines.

To assist I<Test::More> users we have created a special I<Apache::Test>
import tag, C<:withtestmore>, which will export all of the standard
I<Apache::Test> symbols into your namespace except the ones that collide
with I<Test::More>.

    use Apache::Test qw(:withtestmore);
    use Test::More;

    plan tests => 1;           # Test::More::plan()

    ok ('yes', 'testing ok');  # Test::More::ok()

Now, while this works fine for standard client-side tests
(such as C<t/basic.t>), the more advanced features of I<Apache::Test>
require using I<Test::More> as the sole driver behind the scenes.

Should you choose to use I<Test::More> as the backend for
server-based tests (such as C<t/response/TestMe/basic.pm>) you will
need to use the C<-withtestmore> action tag:

    use Apache::Test qw(-withtestmore);

    sub handler {

        my $r = shift;

        plan $r, tests => 1;           # Test::More::plan() with
                                       # Apache::Test features

        ok ('yes', 'testing ok');      # Test::More::ok()
    }

C<-withtestmore> tells I<Apache::Test> to use I<Test::More>
instead of I<Test.pm> behind the scenes.  Note that you are not
required to C<use Test::More> yourself with the C<-withtestmore>
option and that the C<use Test::More tests =E<gt> 1> syntax
may have unexpected results.

Note that I<Test::More> version 0.49, available within the
I<Test::Simple> 0.49 distribution on CPAN, or greater is required
to use this feature.

Because I<Apache:Test> was initially developed using I<Test> as
the framework driver, complete I<Test::More> integration is
considered experimental at this time - it is supported as best as
possible but is not guaranteed to be as stable as the default I<Test>
interface at this time.

=head1 Apache::TestToString Class

The I<Apache::TestToString> class is used to capture I<Test.pm> output
into a string.  Example:

    Apache::TestToString->start;

    plan tests => 4;

    ok $data eq 'foo';

    ...

    # $tests will contain the Test.pm output: 1..4\nok 1\n...
    my $tests = Apache::TestToString->finish;

=head1 SEE ALSO

The Apache-Test tutorial:
L<http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html>.

L<Apache::TestRequest|Apache::TestRequest> subclasses LWP::UserAgent and
exports a number of useful functions for sending request to the Apache test
server. You can then test the results of those requests.

Use L<Apache::TestMM|Apache::TestMM> in your F<Makefile.PL> to set up your
distribution for testing.

Revision history for Perl module Unicode::Collate.

0.25  Mon Jun 06 23:20:17 2003
    - fix Makefile.PL.
    - internal tweak (again): pack_U() and unpack_U().

0.24  Thu Apr 02 23:12:54 2003
    - internal tweak for (?un)pack 'U'.

0.23  Wed Sep 04 19:25:20 2002
    - fix: scalar match() no longer returns an lvalue substr ref.
    - fix: "Ignorable after variable" should be made level 3 ignorable
           even if alternate => 'blanked'.
    - Now a grapheme may contain trailing level 2, level 3,
      and completely ignorable characters.

0.22  Mon Sep 02 23:15:14 2002
    - New File: index.t.
      (The new test.t excludes tests for index.)
    - tweak on index(). POSITION is supported.
    - add match, gmatch, subst, gsubst methods.
    - fix: ignorable after variable in 'shift'-variable weight.

0.21  Sat Aug 03 10:24:00 2002
    - upgrade keys.txt and t/test.t for UCA Version 9.

0.20  Fri Jul 26 02:15:25 2002
    - now UCA Version 9.
    - U+FDD0..U+FDEF are new non-characters.
    - fix: whitespace characters before @backwards etc. in a table file.
    - now values for 'alternate', 'backwards', etc.,
      which are explicitly specified via new(),
      are preferred to those specified in a table file.

0.12  Sun May 05 09:43:10 2002
    - add new methods, ->UCA_Version and ->Base_Unicode_Version.
    - test fix: removed the needless requirement of Unicode::Normalize.
      [reported by David Hand]

0.11  Fri May 03 02:28:10 2002
    - fix: now derived collation elements can be used for Hangul Jamo
      when their weights are not defined.
      [reported by Andreas J. Koenig]
    - fix: rearrangements had not worked.
    - mentioned pleblem on index() in BUGS.
    - more documents, more tests.
    - tag names for 'alternate' are case-insensitive (i.e. 'SHIFTed' etc.).
    - The <undef> value for the keys "overrideCJK", "overrideHangul",
      "rearrange" has a special behavior (different from default).

0.10  Tue Dec 11 23:26:42 2001
    - now you are allowed to use no table file.
    - fix: fetching CE with two or more combining characters.

0.09  Sun Nov 11 17:02:40:18 2001
    - add the following methods: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, le.
    - relies on &Unicode::Normalize::getCombinClass()
      in place of %Unicode::Normalize::Combin
      (the hash is not defined in the XS version of Unicode::Normalize).
      then you should install Unicode::Normalize 0.10 or later.
    - now independent of Lingua::KO::Hangul::Util
      (this module does decomposition of Hangul syllables for itself)

0.08  Mon Aug 20 22:40:18 2001
    - add the index method.

0.07  Thu Aug 16 23:42:02 2001

=head1 NAME

Mac::Files - Macintosh Toolbox Interface to the File and Alias Manager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Constants

Constants for file access permissions.  Use these constants to request a
type of access to a file or fork, or to deny a type of access to a file
or fork to other paths that may request access.

Note that it is possible, on Mac OS 8 and 9, to open a file residing on
read-only media with write access. On Mac OS X, however, you cannot open
a file with write access on read-only media; the attempt to open the
file fails with a wrPermErr error.

=over 4

=item fsCurPerm

Requests whatever permissions are currently allowed. If write access is unavailable (because the file is locked or the file is already open with write permission), then read permission is granted. Otherwise read/write permission is granted.

=item fsRdPerm

Requests permission to read the file.

=item fsWrPerm

Requests permission to write to the file. If write permission is granted, no other access paths are granted write permission. Note, however, that the File Manager does not support write-only access to a file. Thus, fsWrPerm is synonymous with fsRdWrPerm.

=item fsRdWrPerm

Requests exclusive read and write permission. If exclusive read/write permission is granted, no other users are granted permission to write to the file. Other users may, however, be granted permission to read the file.

=item fsRdWrShPerm

Requests shared read and write permission. Shared read/write permission allows mutliple access paths for reading and writing. This is safe only if there is some way of locking portions of the file before writing to them. Use the functions PBLockRangeSync and PBUnlockRangeSync to lock and unlock ranges of bytes within a file. On Mac OS 8 and 9, these functions are supported only on remotely mounted volumes, or on local volumes that are shareable on the network. You should check that range locking is available before requesting shared read/ write permission. On Mac OS X, range locking is available on all volumes.

=item fsRdDenyPerm

Requests that any other paths be prevented from having read access. A path cannot be opened if you request read permission (with the fsRdPerm constant) but some other path has requested deny-read access. Similarly, the path cannot be opened if you request deny-read permission, but some other path already has read access. This constant is used with the PBHOpenDenySync and PBHOpenRFDenySync functions.

=item fsWrDenyPerm

Requests that any other paths be prevented from having write access. A path cannot be opened if you request write permission (with the fsWrPerm constant) but some other path has requested deny-write access. Similarly, the path cannot be opened if you request deny-write permission, but some other path already has write access. This constant is used with the PBHOpenDenySync and PBHOpenRFDenySync functions.

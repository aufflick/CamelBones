=head1 NAME 

YAML::Syck - Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.85 of YAML::Syck, released April 20, 2007.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::Syck;

    # Set this for interoperability with other YAML/Syck bindings:
    # e.g. Load('Yes') becomes 1 and Load('No') becomes undef.
    $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;

    $data = Load($yaml);
    $data = LoadFile($file);
    $yaml = Dump($data);
    DumpFile($file, $data);

    # A string with multiple YAML streams in it
    $yaml = Dump(@data);
    @data = Load($yaml);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the B<libsyck> data serialization
library.  It exports the C<Dump> and C<Load> functions for converting
Perl data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

B<NOTE>: If you are working with other language's YAML/Syck bindings
(such as Ruby), please set C<$YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping> to C<1> before
calling the C<Load>/C<Dump> functions.  The default setting is for
preserving backward-compatibility with C<YAML.pm>.

=head1 FLAGS

=head2 $YAML::Syck::Headless

Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make C<Dump> omit the
leading C<---\n> marker.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::SortKeys

Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make C<Dump> sort
hash keys.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote

Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make C<Dump> always emit
quotes instead of bare strings.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping

Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make C<Load> recognize
various implicit types in YAML, such as unquoted C<true>, C<false>, as well as
integers and floating-point numbers.  Otherwise, only C<~> is recognized to
be C<undef>.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::ImplicitUnicode

Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value will
make C<Load> set Unicode flag on for every string that contains valid UTF8
sequences, and make C<Dump> return a unicode string.

Regardless of this flag, Unicode strings are dumped verbatim without escaping;
byte strings with high-bit set will be dumped with backslash escaping.

However, because YAML does not distinguish between these two kinds of strings,
so this flag will affect loading of both variants of strings.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::ImplicitBinary

Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value will
make C<Dump> generate Base64-encoded C<!!binary> data for all non-Unicode
scalars containing high-bit bytes.

=head2 $YAML::Syck::UseCode

=head2 $YAML::Syck::LoadCode

=head2 $YAML::Syck::DumpCode

These control whether or not to try and eval/deparse perl source code.

=head1 CAVEATS

The current implementation bundles libsyck source code; if your system has a
side-wide shared libsyck, it will I<not> be used.

Tag names such as C<!!perl/hash:Foo> is blessed into the package C<Foo>, but
the C<!hs/foo> and C<!!hs/Foo> tags are blessed into C<hs::Foo>.  Note that
this holds true even if the tag contains non-word characters; for example,
C<!haskell.org/Foo> is blessed into C<haskell.org::Foo>.  Please use
L<Class::Rebless> to cast it into other user-defined packages.

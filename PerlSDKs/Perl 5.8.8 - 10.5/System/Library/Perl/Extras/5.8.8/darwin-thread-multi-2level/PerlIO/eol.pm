=head1 NAME

PerlIO::eol - PerlIO layer for normalizing line endings

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.14 of PerlIO::eol, released 
December 18, 2006.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    binmode STDIN, ":raw:eol(LF)";
    binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF)";
    open FH, "+<:raw:eol(LF-Native)", "file";

    binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF?)"; # warns on mixed newlines
    binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF!)"; # dies on mixed newlines

    use PerlIO::eol qw( eol_is_mixed );
    my $pos = eol_is_mixed( "mixed\nstring\r" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This layer normalizes any of C<CR>, C<LF>, C<CRLF> and C<Native> into the
designated line ending.  It works for both input and output handles.

If you specify two different line endings joined by a C<->, it will use the
first one for reading and the second one for writing.  For example, the
C<LF-CRLF> encoding means that all input should be normalized to C<LF>, and
all output should be normalized to C<CRLF>.

By default, data with mixed newlines are normalized silently.  Append a C<!>
to the line ending will raise a fatal exception when mixed newlines are
spotted.  Append a C<?> will raise a warning instead.

It is advised to pop any potential C<:crlf> or encoding layers before this
layer; this is usually done using a C<:raw> prefix.

This module also optionally exports a C<eol_is_mixed> function; it takes a
string and returns the position of the first inconsistent line ending found
in that string, or C<0> if the line endings are consistent.

The C<CR>, C<LF>, C<CRLF> and C<NATIVE> constants are also exported at request.

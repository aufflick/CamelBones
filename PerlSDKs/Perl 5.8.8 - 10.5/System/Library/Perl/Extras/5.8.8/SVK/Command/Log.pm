__DATA__

=head1 NAME

SVK::Command::Log - Show log messages for revisions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 log DEPOTPATH
 log PATH
 log -r N[:M] [DEPOT]PATH

=head1 OPTIONS

 -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)

                          A revision argument can be one of:

                          "HEAD"       latest in repository
                          NUMBER       revision number
                          NUMBER@      interpret as remote revision number
                          NUM1:NUM2    revision range

                          Unlike other commands,  negative NUMBER has no
                          meaning.

 -l [--limit] REV       : stop after displaying REV revisions
 -q [--quiet]           : Don't display the actual log message itself
 -x [--cross]           : track revisions copied from elsewhere
 -v [--verbose]         : print extra information
    --xml               : display the log messages in XML format
    --filter FILTER     : select revisions based on FILTER
    --output FILTER     : display logs using the given FILTER

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Display the log messages and other meta-data associated with revisions.

SVK provides a flexible system allowing log messages and other revision
properties to be displayed and processed in many ways.  This flexibility comes
through the use of "log filters."  Log filters are of two types: selection and
output.  Selection filters determine which revisions are included in the
output, while output filters determine how the information about those
revisions is displayed.  Here's a simple example.  These two invocations
produce equivalent output:

    svk log -l 5 //local/project
    svk log --filter "head 5" --output std //local/project

The "head" filter chooses only the first revisions that it encounters, in this
case, the first 5 revisions.  The "std" filter displays the revisions using
SVK's default output format.

Selection filters can be connected together into pipelines.  For example, to
see the first 3 revisions with log messages containing the string 'needle', we
might do this

    svk log --filter "grep needle | head 3" //local/project

That example introduced the "grep" filter.  The argument for the grep filter
is a valid Perl pattern (with any '|' characters as '\|' and '\' as '\\').  A
revision is allowed to continue to the next stage of the pipeline if the
revision's log message matches the pattern.  If we wanted to search only the
first 10 revisions for 'needle' we could use either of the following commands

    svk log --filter "head 10 | grep needle" //local/project
    svk log -l 10 --filter "grep needle" //local/project

You may change SVK's default output filter by setting the SVKLOGOUTPUT
environment.  See B<svk help environment> for details.

=head2 Standard Filters

The following log filters are included with the standard SVK
distribution:

    Selection : grep, head, author
    Output    : std, xml

For detailed documentation about any of these filters, try "perldoc
SVK::Log::Filter::Name" where "Name" is "Grep", "Head", "XML", etc.. Other log
filters are available from CPAN L<http://search.cpan.org> by searching for
"SVK::Log::Filter".  For details on writing log filters, see the documentation
for the SVK::Log::Filter module.

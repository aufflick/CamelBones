SVK::Help::View - Introduction to svk view support

=head1 DESCRIPTION

[Views are a BETA-quality feature. We're very interested in bug reports 
and feeback about them.]

svk allows you to define multiple different I<view>s for an existing
repository.

=head2 DEFINING A VIEW

views are stored as property C<svk:view:NAME> on a directory.  Suppose
you have C<svk:view:ptest> set on C<//project>, you can refer to it by
C<//^project/ptest>.  That is, a caret, and then path holding the
property, a slash, and the name of the view.

You can now use C<//^project/ptest> as a target for normal svk commands
like ls, checkout and diff.

Here is an example for the value of the property:

 &:/project/trunk
 -*
 dir1  dir1
 util  src/deep/util

The first line is the base of the view.  The C<&:> sign means the root
of a mirror, so the view can still be used even if other people
mirrored the repository to a different path in their local repository.

The second line means taking out all the content under the root.  And
then take C<dir1> back, stick the directory C<src/deep/util> to
C<util> under the view.  So running C<svk ls //^project/ptest> you
should see:

 dir1/
 util/

=cut

1;

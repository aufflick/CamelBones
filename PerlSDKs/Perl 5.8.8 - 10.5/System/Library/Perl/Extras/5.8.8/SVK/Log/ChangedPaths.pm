=head1 NAME
 
SVK::Log::ChangedPaths - partly lazy list of SVK::Log::ChangedPath objects
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
    use SVK::Log::ChangedPaths;
    my $changed_paths = SVK::Log::ChangedPaths->new( $root );
    for my $changed_path ( $changed_paths->paths() ) {
        ...
    }
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents a collection of details about the
files/directories that were changed in a particular revision.  Some log
filters want access to information about which paths were affected during a
certain revision and others don't.  Using this object allows the calculation
of path details to be postponed until it's truly needed.
 
 
=head1 METHODS 
 
=head2 new

Accepts the return value of C<< SVK::Path->root() >> as a parameter and constructs a
SVK::Log::ChangedPaths object from it.

=head2 paths

Returns a list of L<SVK::Log::ChangedPath> objects each of which represents
the details of the changes to a particular path.
 
 
=head1 DIAGNOSTICS
 
None
 
=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
 
SVK::Log::ChangedPaths requires no configuration files or environment variables.

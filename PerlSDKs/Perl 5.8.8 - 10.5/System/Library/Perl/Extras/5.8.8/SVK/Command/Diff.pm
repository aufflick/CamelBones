__DATA__

=head1 NAME

SVK::Command::Diff - Display diff between revisions or checkout copies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 diff [-r REV] [PATH...]
 diff -r N[:M] DEPOTPATH
 diff -c N DEPOTPATH
 diff DEPOTPATH1 DEPOTPATH2
 diff DEPOTPATH PATH

=head1 OPTIONS

 -r [--revision] arg    : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
 -c [--change]   rev    : show change from rev-1 to rev (reverse if negative)

                          A revision argument can be one of:

                          "HEAD"       latest in repository
                          NUMBER       revision number
                          NUMBER@      interpret as remote revision number
                          NUM1:NUM2    revision range

                          Given negative NUMBER means "HEAD"+NUMBER.
                          (Counting backwards)

 -s [--summarize]       : show summary only
 -v [--verbose]         : print extra information
 -X [--expand]          : expand files copied as new files
 -N [--non-recursive]   : do not descend recursively

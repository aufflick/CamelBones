=head1 NAME

SVK::Patch - Class representing a patch to be applied

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Using SVK::Patch
 $patch = SVK::Patch->load ($file, $xd, $depotname);
 $patch->view;
 # update patch for target
 $patch->update;
 # regenerate patch from source branch
 $patch->regen;

 # apply the patch to designated target
 $patch->apply ($check_only);
 # apply to arbitrary target
 $patch->apply_to ($target, $storage, %cb);

 # Creating SVK::Patch
 $patch = SVK::Patch->new ('my patch', $xd, $depotname, $src, $dst);
 $editor = $patch->editor
 # feed things to $editor
 $patch->store ($file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SVK::Patch represents tree delta and assorted meta data, such as merge
info and anchor for the patch to be applied.

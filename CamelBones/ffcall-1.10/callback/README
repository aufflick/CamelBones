callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions

This library implements closures with variable arguments and variable return
values as first-class C functions. A closure consists of a regular C function
and a piece of data which gets passed to the C function when the closure is
called.

This library is especially suited to the implementation of call-back functions
in embedded interpreters.

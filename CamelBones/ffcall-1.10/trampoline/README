trampoline - closures as first-class C functions.

This library implements closures as first-class C functions. A closure
consists of a regular C function and a piece of data which gets passed to
the C function when the closure is called.

Typical uses of closures are nested functions in programming languages,
and call-back functions passed to other libraries.

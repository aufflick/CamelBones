ffcall - foreign function call libraries

This is a collection of four libraries which can be used to build
foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.

The four packages are:

    avcall - calling C functions with variable arguments

    vacall - C functions accepting variable argument prototypes

    trampoline - closures as first-class C functions

    callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions
               (a reentrant combination of vacall and trampoline)


Installation instructions:

        ./configure
        make
        make check
        make install
